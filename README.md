7T MRI scans of my brain, plus some 3D models generated from the data

### tl;dr
I got my brain scanned in a super high-resolution MRI as a healthy control in a study. I requested I get a copy of that data back and I'm sharing it here now for others to explore and play with.

### Update
Despite my best compression efforts, the scan files themselves are just too big so I'll be setting up an ftp server to host them

### Long Version
(coming soon)
